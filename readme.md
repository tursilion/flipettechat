Flipette Chat was originally written for STOS BASIC on the Atari ST. It was ported (loosely speaking) to QBASIC by removing or commenting out the STOS graphics commands. I don't think the original source exists anymore.

This code runs fine under Blassic - https://blassic.net/

It also runs under QB64 - https://qb64.org/

Between these two of these, you should be able to run this just about anywhere.

The software basically runs on the same concept as the old Eliza, the only improvements being basic substitution and remembering the last subject.
